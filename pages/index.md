# Title: Macroeconomic Variables and Their Causal Relationship with Money Laundering




## Project Overview: Analyzing Risk and Investment
This report is a response to a hypothetical corporate investigation that seeks to identify key historical and geographical factors for the detection of money laundering.


The objective of this work is to leverage macroeconomic data to better understand the flows of economic crime. The findings can be used to inform investment decisions by assessing the risks and potential of various countries and regions.


This analysis aims to provide a clearer picture of where to invest, what the preventive costs will be, and the ongoing management and compliance costs associated with mitigating elevated non-financial risks.


Ultimately, it also helps to forecast compliance-related misconduct in countries, enabling proactive risk mitigation.
